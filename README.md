Designed primarily as a learning project to understand OOP, animation, and collision handling in Python.

🧰 Built With
🐢 turtle – for rendering game graphics and animation

🪟 tkinter.messagebox – for displaying game result popups


🧩 Custom modules:

Paddle – class for the paddle logic

Ball – class for ball movement and collision

variables – central place for managing screen and boundary dimensions


🎮 Gameplay
Two-player mode:
